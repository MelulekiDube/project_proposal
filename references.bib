Generally, ICT includes computers, mobile communication devices and networks. ICT is also embraced by a group of people with malicious intent, also known as network intruders, cyber criminals, etc. Confronting these detrimental cyber activities is one of the international priorities and important research area. Anomaly detection is an important data analysis task which is useful for identifying the network intrusions. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of four major categories of anomaly detection techniques which include classification, statistical, information theory and clustering. The paper also discusses research challenges with the datasets used for network intrusion detection."}@ARTICLE{8357700, 	author={B. {Hussain} and Q. {Du} and P. {Ren}}, 	journal={China Communications}, 	title={Semi-supervised learning based big data-driven anomaly detection in mobile wireless networks}, 	year={2018}, 	volume={15}, 	number={4}, 	pages={41-57}, 	keywords={4G mobile communication;Big Data;cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;mobile radio;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic;big data;semisupervised learning;mobile wireless networks;cellular networks;machine learning algorithms;4G LTE-A;semisupervised statistical-based anomaly detection technique;resource allocation;fault avoidance solution;reliability;Anomaly detection;Cellular networks;Big Data;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Microprocessors;Computer architecture;5G;4G LTE-A;anomaly detection;call detail record;machine learning;big data analytics;network behavior analysis;sleeping cell}, 	doi={10.1109/CC.2018.8357700}, 	ISSN={1673-5447}, 	month={April},}@ARTICLE{7307098, 	author={A.

Effective visualization allows people to gain insights into the data information and discovery of communication patterns of network flows. Such information may be difficult for human to perceive its relationships due to its numeric nature such as time, packet size, inter-packet time, and many other statistical features. Many existing work fail to provide an effective visualization method for big network traffic data. This work proposes a novel and effective method for visualizing network traffic data with statistical features of high dimensions. We combine Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Mutidimensional Scaling (MDS) to effectively reduce dimensionality and use colormap for enhance visual quality for human beings. We obtain high quality images on a real-world network traffic dataset named `ISP'. Comparing with the popular t-SNE method, our visualization method is more flexible and scalable for plotting network traffic data which may require to preserve multi-dimensional information and relationship. Our plots also demonstrate the capability of handling a large amount of data. Using our method, the readers will be able to visualize their network traffic data as an alternative method of t-SNE.",	issn="1573-7721",	doi="10.1007/s11042-017-5495-y",	url="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-017-5495-y"}@Misc{inethi,	howpublished = {\url{http://inethi.org.za/}},	note = {Accessed April 29, 2019},	title = {Inethi Community Network},	author = {Inethi}}@inproceedings{Braem:2015:AEQ:2830629.2830639,	author = {Braem, Bart and Bergs, Johan and Blondia, Chris and Navarro, Leandro and Wittevrongel, Sabine},	title = {Analysis of End-User QoE in Community Networks},	booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Symposium on Computing for Development},	series = {DEV '15},	year = {2015},	isbn = {978-1-4503-3490-7},	location = {London, United Kingdom},	pages = {159--166},	numpages = {8},	url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2830629.2830639},	doi = {10.1145/2830629.2830639},	acmid = {2830639},	publisher = {ACM},	address = {New York, NY, USA},	keywords = {community networks, quality of experience},}
