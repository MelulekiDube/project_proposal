Generally, ICT includes computers, mobile communication devices and networks. ICT is also embraced by a group of people with malicious intent, also known as network intruders, cyber criminals, etc. Confronting these detrimental cyber activities is one of the international priorities and important research area. Anomaly detection is an important data analysis task which is useful for identifying the network intrusions. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of four major categories of anomaly detection techniques which include classification, statistical, information theory and clustering. The paper also discusses research challenges with the datasets used for network intrusion detection."}@ARTICLE{8357700, 	author={B. {Hussain} and Q. {Du} and P. {Ren}}, 	journal={China Communications}, 	title={Semi-supervised learning based big data-driven anomaly detection in mobile wireless networks}, 	year={2018}, 	volume={15}, 	number={4}, 	pages={41-57}, 	keywords={4G mobile communication;Big Data;cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;mobile radio;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic;big data;semisupervised learning;mobile wireless networks;cellular networks;machine learning algorithms;4G LTE-A;semisupervised statistical-based anomaly detection technique;resource allocation;fault avoidance solution;reliability;Anomaly detection;Cellular networks;Big Data;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Microprocessors;Computer architecture;5G;4G LTE-A;anomaly detection;call detail record;machine learning;big data analytics;network behavior analysis;sleeping cell}, 	doi={10.1109/CC.2018.8357700}, 	ISSN={1673-5447}, 	month={April},}@ARTICLE{7307098, 	author={A.
