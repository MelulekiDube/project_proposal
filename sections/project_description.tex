 \section{Project Description}
 This comprises a high-level introduction to the problem and must be as clear as possible: short sentences, citations, all technical terms all explained.
 
What is the problem? Why is it important? What are the issues/difficulties?

There has been industrial and academic endeavours to characterise the internet through network measurements. However none of the prominent tools have been used in a significant way in developing regions especially in wireless community networks.

One of the challenges is that community networks are vastly different from known large internet networks[1]. They are implemented using cheap hardware and networking methods. This gives them a unique architecture that makes it difficult for these common tools to be deployed with ease in community networks.

Network measurement tools are now important to all users from administrators to general users. Without measurement platforms that provide a clear visualisation of network activity, administrators must scroll through long unorganized tables of data collected from the network to make sense of the activity in the network. This is an inefficient and time consuming task which deters the detection anomalous behaviour.

With a large number of people getting connected, users often want to know their network usage and their footprint on the internet. For example a user maybe interested in knowing the data they consumed over a specific amount of time, the services they use the most or how often they use the internet. Users also want this data delivered in a user friendly way hence the need for an elegant tool to visualise the data.

This project therefore aims at building a distributed platform for collecting and analysing internet quality of service(QoS) metrics within the context of a wireless community network. The platform should be able to help detect sub-optimal or anomalous traffic flows, such as due to misconfiguration or network attacks.

To achieve this, the project will build a set of distributed internet measurement units to collect internet performance data sets in community networks. The platform will also incorporate feature selection mechanisms for detecting and correlating factors impacting QoS.
