When creating a Quality of Services monitoring system, one aspect that is needed is the measurements and collection of data from the mobile phones. Therefore, we looked at works that has been done in this regard. We looked into systems that collected data from phones and those that collected data from more complex nodes \cite{7523537, Shepard:2011:LMW:1925019.1925023}.

Shepard et al \cite{Shepard:2011:LMW:1925019.1925023} summarized the challenges involved when collecting measurements from mobiles phones. These challenges include legal issues and power consumed by these types of measurement systems. The Live-Lab systems \cite{Shepard:2011:LMW:1925019.1925023} looked into eliminating these challenges by providing a systems which was capable of running internet measurements on different iPhone 3 mobile devices. We adopt the hashing of data measurement data sent from phones for ensuring anonymity of data sent from forms from the works done by \cite{Shepard:2011:LMW:1925019.1925023}.

From the work by \cite{7523537,8255998} Cassandra database was the database that was used for storing the collected for its fast loading and querying perks. We however are going to use a time series database as most of the queries that will be done from the database are going to be time based. For this reason we will be using Influx Database as the database for our system.

Other work included MONROE, which is a platform for running large-scale measurements and experiments in operational Mobile Brodband networks\cite{7523537}.One of MONROE functionalities is its ability to run real-time user defined measurements together with data analysis on a few selected nodes available across Europe\cite{7523537}. These measurements are initiated through a user-friendly web graphical interface that remotely controlled hundreds of nodes scattered over four European countries, with the purpose of assessing network performance\cite{7523537}. In the implementation of our measurement orchestration functionality we will replicate aspects of MONROE design to enable remote triggering of nodes in the community network to collect user-defined measurements at scheduled time periods.

In terms of anomaly detection, classification based systems are found to be the most accurate in the detecting intrusions in the network according to \cite{AHMED201619}\cite{6524462}. This is the case, due to the presence of several datasets available for evaluating network anomaly detection methods and systems for example NSL-KDD dataset \cite{6524462}. They are found to be accurate on common attacks such as Denial
of Service (DoS), User to Root (U2R), Remote to Local (R2L),
and Probe or Scan\cite{7307098}. In the case of new network attacks classification systems tend to be very ineffective as they can not accurately detect attacks they have not dealt with before\cite{AHMED201619}. Unsupervised methods on the other hand tend to perform well as they group data based on how similar they are and since normal network traffic tends to occur more than anomalous data, it can be detected relatively accurately\cite{8357700}.
