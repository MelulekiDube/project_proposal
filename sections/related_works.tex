Since we are creating a Quality of Services monitoring system, one aspect that is needed is the measurements and collection of data from the mobile phones. Therefore we looked at works that has been done in this regard. We looked into systems that collected data from phones and those that collected data from more complex nodes \cite{7523537, Shepard:2011:LMW:1925019.1925023}.

One of the important works that was looked at summarized the challenges involved when collecting measurements from mobiles phones. These challenges included legal issues and power consumed by these types measurement systems \cite{Shepard:2011:LMW:1925019.1925023}. The Live-Lab systems \cite{Shepard:2011:LMW:1925019.1925023} looked into eliminating these challenges by providing a systems which was capable of running internet measurements on different iPhone 3 mobile devices. The implementation details of this system were provided and thus for our monitoring systems we can adapt more from the system.

From the work by \cite{7523537,8255998} Cassandra database was the database that was sued for storing the collected for its fast loading and querying perks. We will therefore be looking into also using a Cassandra like database, that is a column store type of database.
