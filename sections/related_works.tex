MONROE is a platform for running large-scale measurements and experiments in operational Mobile Brodband networks.MONROE handled experiments that range from continuous latency measurements to real time flows.One of MONROE functionalities' is its ability to trigger nodes to run tests on the network
with the purpose of properly assessing network performance.In the implementation of orchestration functionality for this application we intend to replicate their design so as to provide networks operators with a way to schedule network measurements when required %NEED to Cite
