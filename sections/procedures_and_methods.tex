\section{Procedure And Methods}
\subsection{Development Procedure}
We need to develop a phone application that will be our means of collecting measurements for the internet metrics. We have decided to build an android application for the phones and tablets as Android is open and requires less resources to get started. According to \cite{statcounter_global_stats}, Android currently has 35\% of the operating systems market. This shows how popular amongst users android is and thus will be a good platform to consider to build the application for first.

The application that we will be building will be extending the MobiPerf application which is built in Java \cite{m}.
