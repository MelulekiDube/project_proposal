\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Aims and Research Question}
The aim of this project is to provide researchers and operators of the network, with a tool they can use to perform measurements on the community network ,also with the ability schedule collection of network data at specified times.The project also aims to provide end users with the ability to view their data usage accurately in a very user friendly manner.All the functionality discussed previously will be collectively packaged together in a easy to use visualization tool.The ultimate goal of the application is to use the data collected enhance quality of service, prevent attack on the network as well as contribute further to the research in community networks.

\subsection{Requirements}
Our research takes on the form of a software engineering project with memebers of the inethi community network as the primary user of the application.The application needs to meet their requirements for it to be of use.
 
Requirement of the tools is as follows 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide functionality to perform measurements on the network based on different user-defined fields such latency,signal strength or throughput.
	
	\item Enable the scheduling of network measurements either on demand or at specified time.  
	
	\item Detection of anomalies in the network based on the analysis of the data collected in the network.
	
	\item Creation of user profiles which can be use tod track their data usage in the network. 
	
	\item Provide data visualization to both end users in the viewing of their user profiles as well to network operators in the monitoring of the network.
\end{itemize}
Thorough testing and prototyping is paramount,to ensure we meet the requirements, and to provide Inethi with a tool that they are satisfied with.
