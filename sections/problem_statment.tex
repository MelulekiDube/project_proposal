\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Aims and Research Question}
The aim of this project is to provide porate feature selection mechanisms for detecting and correlating factors impacting QoS.
researchers and operators of the network with a tool they can use to perform measurements on the community network, also with the ability to schedule collection of network data at specified times. The project also aims to provide end users with the ability to view their data usage accurately in a very user friendly manner. All the functionality discussed previously will be collectively packaged together in a easy to use visualization tool. The ultimate goal of the application is to use the data collected enhance quality of service, prevent attack on the network as well as contribute further to the research in community networks.

The main question that we will be seeking to answer with the project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
	\item How do different measurement collection techniques compare to each other in terms of power efficiency and network efficiency. Where network efficiency focuses on the effects of collecting measurements on the network. Power efficiency looks into the effects on power utilization on of the measurement collection technique used.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements}
Our research takes on the form of a software engineering project with members of the Inethi community network as the primary user of the application. The application needs to meet their requirements for it to be of use.
\subsubsection{research questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item investigate the effect of co-design process for network based web application interface through usability evaluation
\end{itemize}
Requirements of the application are as follows 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide functionality to perform measurements on the network based on different user-defined fields such latency, signal strength or throughput.
	
	\item Enable the scheduling of network measurements either on demand or at specified time.  
	
	\item Detection of anomalies in the network based on the analysis of the data collected in the network.
	
	\item Creation of user profiles which can be use to track their data usage in the network. 
	
	\item Provide data visualization to both end users in the viewing of their user profiles as well to network operators in the monitoring of the network.
\end{itemize}
Thorough testing and prototyping is paramount, to ensure we meet the requirements, and to provide Inethi with a tool that they are satisfied with.
